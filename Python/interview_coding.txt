8. You are provided with data on students and their scores in various subjects. 
Your task is to manipulate this data using Pandas, dictionaries, lists, and tuples to perform a series of transformations and calculations.

Given Data:
A list of tuples, where each tuple contains a student's name and their marks in three subjects: Mathematics, Science, and English
data =
    ("Alice", 85, 92, 78),
    ("Bob", 79, 80, 85),
    ("Charlie", 90, 95, 88),
    ("David", 72, 85, 82),
    ("Eve", 88, 79, 91)


Convert the given list of tuples into a Pandas DataFrame with the following columns: 'Name', 'Mathematics', 'Science', 'English'.
Calculate the average score of each student across all subjects and store it in a new column called 'Average'.
Create a dictionary where the keys are student names, and the values are their respective average scores.
Filter out the students with an average score of 85 or more and store their names in a list.
Return the names of the top two students based on their average scores as a tuple.
